#### TODO
- [X] upload code from vimrc :P
- [ ] convert code to proper plugin ^_^
- [ ] fix only directional mapping (only keys from client [file that launched minimap] update server [minimap]) instead it should be able to go both ways (bi-directional)
- [ ] fix odd issues
- [ ] release first version? o_O
